Vaster than 1a longhouse|an orchard1, stronger than 2a Jarl|an ox2,\n
No man has ever seen it, 22but each man knows its snarl| on windowpanes it knocks22.\n
Quicker than 3a war horse|a swallow3, it flies from 4far away|far off lands4,\n
Flinging open storerooms 44and stealing unbound hay|without paws or hands44.\n
